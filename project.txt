/*  A my own WC - word count utility, for the *NIX operating system and   */
/*                for the OpenVMS operating system                        */
Rules:

*NIX style command line is XX -a -b -c files ...
Will be named as nix style suffix

VMS style command line is XX /A /B /C files ...
Will be named as vms style suffix

#ifdef VMS || OpenVMS
   parse_cmd();
#else
   parse_cmd();
#endif

Will be try to check all value of variable to avoid
possible bugs. For instance:
 int variable has maximum = 2147483647 and if file size more than
 2147483647 bytes - print warning and exit, do not make summarize

For a my own version of wc (word count) I will use:
unsigned int - for the counters of words, characters and lines,
so - max file size will be 4294967295 bytes.

Also will be add a few new options:
- counters of character table;
- help.
